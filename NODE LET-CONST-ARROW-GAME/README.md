#  Convert to ES6 Syntax

* As a developer, I want to be able to recognize and implement newer ES6 syntax.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I understand the application's functionality in `index.html` and `index.js`. 

* It's done when I have converted `var` to `const` or `let` based on the use case.

* It's done when I have converted all functional expressions to arrow functions.

## ðŸ’¡ Hint

When is it not suitable to use arrow functions?
