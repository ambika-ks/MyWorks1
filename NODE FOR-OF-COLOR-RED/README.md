# Implement and Use for...of Loops

Implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to use `for...of` loops to iterate through data inside objects.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have selected all the inside `#songs` elements in the `html`.

* It's done when I have iterated through the song collection with a `for...of` loop and added a `class` of `red` to each element.

## 💡 Hint

What part of the object is essential in setting up the iteration of a `for...of` loop?

## EXTRA

* How could you iterate through deeply nested objects?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
