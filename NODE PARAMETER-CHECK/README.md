# Implement `process.argv`

* As a developer, I want to use command-line arguments as input when writing Node.js applications.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created a file, `index.js`, in the working directory.

* It's done when I use `process.argv` to assign two arguments to variables.

* It's done when I compare those two variables to see whether they are the same or not.

* It's done if the program returns `true` when the values are the same and `false` if they are not. 

##  Hint

There is not just one correct solution.

## EXTRA

Work through the following 

* What is the difference between `===` and `==` when comparing two values in JavaScript?
